# Contributing File

# Welcome to pyQuARC!
This page is meant to help you learn how you can contribute to pyQuARC Content! We are passionate about NASA's Open Science initiative and we want your help. Read below to find ways that you can contribute to our project, either through reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or even directly editing the code yourself! 
## Getting Started
#### What is pyQuARC? 
PyQuARC is a tool that can helpp streamline the process of metadata assessment by automating it as much as possible. It completes basic validation checks, flags areas that need contextual metadata, and confirms information associated with both the collection level metadata and granuale level metadata are consistent. Read more about pyQuARC in the project's [**Read Me File**](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pyQuARC?tab=readme-ov-file#pyquarc). 

## How you can contributute to pyQuARC:
We will start realativly simple, and progress to the more difficult ways to contribute. 

1. **Report a Bug:** for when you find something within the code that does not respond the way you expected/wanted it to.
   * To start you will need to proceed to the **Issues** tab within the [pyQuARC Github Page](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pyQuARC/issues). 
   * From here, look for the green button on the right side of the page labeled **New issue**. 
   * Select **Bug Report** from the list that appears, so that you can create a report to help us improve an aspect of pyQuARC.
   * The page you are directed to will provide a prompt to add a title and explains how to fill in the bug you are wanting to report. 
   * If you change your mind about reporting a bug, there is a white button on the bottom right of the page labeled **Cancel** where you can either decide to keep editing or close and discard your issue.
   * When you are finished describing the bug you wish to report, you can click the big green button at the bottom of the page labeled **Create**. This will make your Issue visible to all pyQuARC contributers and will help us to make pyQuARC more user friendly!
   * You can see your new issue if you return to the **Issues** page of the pyQuARC GitHub and look for your title followed by the red __bug__ tag. 
   * Thank you for submitting a bug report to our team! We know that your report will help to better pyQuARC for everyone.

2. **Suggest a New Feature:** for when you think of something that could enhance pyQuARC for other users.
   * Suggesting a new feature is very similar to reporting a bug. You will start at the **Issues** tab within the [pyQuARC Github Page](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pyQuARC/issues). 
   * Select the green **New Issue** button found on the top right side of the page.
   * From the menu that appears, select **Feature Request** so that you can suggest an idea for our project.
   * The page you are directed to will provide a prompt to add a title and explains how to make a new suggestion. 
   * If you change your mind about making a feature request, there is a white button on the bottom right of the page labeled **Cancel** where you can either decide to keep editing or close and discard your issue.
   * When you are finished describing your suggestion, you can click the big green button at the bottom of the page labeled **Create**. This will make your Issue visible to all pyQuARC contributers and will help us to make pyQuARC more user friendly!
   * You can see your new issue if you return to the **Issues** page of the pyQuARC GitHub and look for your title followed by the green __new check__ tag. 
   * Thank you for suggesting a new feature or enhancment to our team! Your suggestiong will help us to better pyQuARC for everyone. 

3. **Directly Contribute to PyQuARC Content:** for when you want to directly edit the code to add checks, or play around and see how things work. 
   * To edit the code you will need to first create your own 'fork' of the repository. A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibilty settings with the original repository, but allows you to create your own edits freely without changing the original repository. Read more about Forks [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
   * To create your own fork of pyQuARC, return to the [**Code**](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pyQuARC) tab of the pyQuARC GitHub.
     * On the top right of the page select the **Fork** tab. 
     * Under the "Owner" dropdowm menu select yourself as the owner of the new forked repository.
     * The fork name will default to 'pyQuARC'. If you wish to name your fork something different, edit the 'Repository Name' field. 
     * You can set an optional description in the 'Description' field below.
     * Make sure the checkbox next to 'Copy the master branch only' is checked. 
     * Click **Create fork** when you are finished to create your fork!
   * After completing the steps above, you should be in a new page titled the same as your new fork. You have successfully created a fork of pyQuARC! You shpuld be able to see all the pyQuARC files and the Read Me. 
   * Now we will store the files locally on your computer so you will be able to edit the code. Click the green dropdown button labeled **<> Code**. 
   * Under the **HTTPS** tab, copy the link to the repository. 
   * Open a python terminal in your preferred coding location.
   * Change your working directory to wherever you want your cloned pyQuARC repository to be stored.
   * Type '__git clone__' and then paste the URL you copied a few steps above. 
   * Press **Enter** and your local clone of pyQuARC will be created! You can now explore all of the files on your local computer and make changes as you wish.
